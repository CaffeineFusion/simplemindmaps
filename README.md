# simplemindmaps
A simple mind map interface built with the HTML5 canvas

Most of the mind mapping tools around seem significantly bloated. 
The aim of this project is to create a simple, portable and extensible mind mapping tool.
I intend to use this as the backbone for a larger mind mapping project.

Added Handlebars and Express to build a minimal web interface for initial testing, demo and template for use. My intention is for the underlying library to be entirely independent of these.

# Please Note:
This is in the very earliest stages of development and is not yet functional.
